PERSONALIZATION
This directory contains the template for a generic BiCi event web
site.  You need to personalize it by editing the following files:

./page_header.html
./index.shtml
program/index.shtml
dates/index.shtml
organization/index.shtml
registration/index.shtml
sponsorship/index.shtml
participants/index.shtml

In all files, you can search for the string EDIT_THIS to find the locations for
customization.  Note that the 3 files location/index.shtml, howto/index.shtml
and weather/index.shtml do NOT require personalization as they obtain their
content remotely.

SERVER-SIDE INCLUDES (SSI)
The file page_header.shtml is a global header file included by all other
files.  You need to insert the acronym and long name of your event there.
Apache HTTP Servers typically have SSI enabled, but if you must enable it
manually, add the following directives in your httpd.conf file:

	Options +Includes
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

If for some reason you cannot configure your web server to support SSI,
then you need to physically insert the contents of the file
page_header.html into the other files in place of the line

<!--#include virtual="page_header.html" -->

STYLE SHEET AND IMAGES
The images and the BiCi style sheet are loaded remotely and you should
NOT make local copies or modify them.  This allows all events to have a
uniform "look-and-feel" and it allows me to correct/update information once
for the benefit of all.

ADDING NEW PAGES
The template contains place holders for a set of typical event pages.  If you
should need a page that is not included in the template, you will need to
first create the new page and manually edit the navigation bar code in
all of the existing index.shtml files.  Suppose you want to add a page for
"Awards".  Create a new directory called "awards" and copy one of the existing
index.shtml files (say, dates/index.shtml) into the directory.  Edit the
file awards/index.shtml and search for the string "Start Navigation".  In
the <ul> list, insert a new <li> at the point where you want the new page to
appear in the sidebar with the following text

          <li><a href="index.shtml"
              rel="self"
              id="current"
              name="current">Awards</a></li>

Make sure you edit the entry for "Important Dates" by removing the
id="current" tag and editing the link to be href="dates/index.shtml".
You will have to edit all other index.shtml files making analogous changes.
